    "# Introduction to JupyterLab and IPython\n",

    "This is a notebook to introduce Python and jupyter notebook to beginners. Jupyter and IPython are REPL flavours of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "REPL stands for *Read-Eval-Print-Loop*. It is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment allows you to rapid run, test and develop codes and scripts and analyse data. It is widely used in data science, machine learning and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce the most basic concepts of Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cells\n",
    "Each code is organised in blocks called cells. You can run a cell by selecting it and pressing `Shift+Enter` or by clicking the Play button in the toolbar above. This will run the code and move to the next cell or create a new one if it doesn't exist."
